Activity 1
Given the list fruit_list, write a script that iterates through the list and prints each item on a separate line.

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry",
"kumquat", "orange", "pineapple"]
 
for i in range(len(fruit_list)):
  print(fruit_list[i])


Activity 2
Write a Python script that asks the user for a string and displays the characters of the string to the user, with each character on a new line.

For example, if the input is Hello, the output should be:

H
e
l
l
o

inp=input("Enter a word: ")
for i in range(len(inp)):
  print(inp[i])

Activity 3
Write a Python script that computes the length of a string without using the len() function.

inp=input("Enter a word: ")
count=0
for i in inp:
  count+=1
print(count)

Activity 4
Create a program that starts with a list of strings, identifies all the strings with more than two characters, stores the results in another list, and displays the new list.
For example:
a = ["a", "bc", "rye", "hello", "c", ""]
Output:
["rye", "hello"]

l=["donut", "apple", "egg", "cheese", "popsicle", "puff", "pineapple", "orange", "is"]
new_l=[]
for i in range(len(l)):
  if len(l[i])>2:
    new_l.append(l[i])
print(new_l)

Activity 5
Write two scripts, each of which displays all numbers divisible by 50 between 100 and 1000 (inclusive).
Use the range function with for in one script.
Use while without range in the other script.
Both scripts should have identical outputs.
# script 1: range
for i in range(100,1001):
  if i%50==0:
    print(i)

# script 2: while
num=100
while num<1001:
  if num%50==0:
    print(num)
  num+=1


Activity 6
Create a script that computes the sum of all numbers between 0 and 100.
total=0
for i in range(0,101):
  total+=i
print(total)


Activity 7
Create a script that computes the factorial of any given number.

import math
num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
fact=math.factorial(num)
print(f"factorial of {num} is {fact}.")


Activity 8
Starting with the defined fruit_list in the code block below, update the script to perform the following tasks.
Prompt the user to enter the name of a fruit.
If the fruit is in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to the user and tell the user its index value in the list.
If the fruit is not in fruit_list, display an appropriate message to the user and prompt them to try again.
The script should repeat itself until the user enters a stop word at the prompt.
Tip: It's always a good idea to tell the user how to end a loop!

fruit_list = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "gooseberry", "kumquat", "orange", "pineapple"]
while True:
  fruit_name=input("Enter a fruit name (type 'done' when you are done!): ")
  if fruit_name in fruit_list:
    print(f"index: {fruit_list.index(fruit_name)}")
  elif fruit_name=="done".lower():
    break
  else:
    print(f"oops, {fruit_name} is not in in the list. Please try again!")

Activity 9
Create a script that asks the user for a variable number of values and displays the sum of those values to the user. The program should prompt the user for values until the user enters the word "quit" (uppercase or lowercase), display the values used in the calculation, and then display the total of those values.

num_list=[]
while True:
  num=input("Enter a value (type 'quit' when you are done!): ")
  try:
    num=float(num)
    num_list.append(num)
    continue
  except:
    if num=="quit".lower():
       break
    else:
      print("please enter numerical values or 'quit' only.")
      continue
total=0
for i in num_list:
  total+=i
print(f"the valules include {num_list}")
print(f"total: {total}")

Activity 10
Write a script that asks the user for an integer value and then displays the multiplication table of that input number from 1 through the integer squared.
num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(1,num**2+1):
  result=num*i
  print(f"{i}*{num}={result}")

Activity 11
Create a script that identifies all prime numbers between 0 and 100.
for num in range(1,101):
   if num > 1:
       for i in range(2, num):
           if (num % i) == 0:
               break
       else:
           print(num)

Activity 12
Write a script that calculates the greatest common denominator between two numbers.
For example, given the numbers 18 and 27, the greatest common denominator is 9.

import math
num1=int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2=int(input("Enter another number: "))
gcd=math.gcd(num1, num2)
print (f"GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd}")

Activity 13
Write a Python script that computes the frequency of each digit in a given integer.

For example, if the input number is 334, the output should be:

3 occurs 2 times
4 occurs 1 time

import pandas as pd
num = input("Enter an integer: ")
print(pd.Series(list(num)).value_counts())


Activity 14
Write a script that calculates the lowest common multiple of two given integers.

For example, given the values 4 and 6, the lowest common multiple is 12.

import math
num1=int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2=int(input("Enter another number: "))
lcm=math.lcm(num1, num2)
print (f"LCM of {num1} and {num2} is {lcm}")



Activity 15
Write a Python script that determines if an input number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

For example, the number 10 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers:

10 = 3 + 7 : both prime numbers
10 = 5 + 5 : both prime numbers
However, the number 11 cannot be:

11 = 1 + 10 : neither 1 nor 10 are prime numbers
11 = 2 + 9 : 9 is not a prime number
11 = 3 + 8 : 8 is not a prime number
11 = 4 + 7 : 4 is not a prime number
11 = 5 + 6 : 6 is not a prime number

Number = int(input('Enter the Number : '))
arr = []
for i in range(2, Number):
    flag = 0
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            flag = 1
    if flag == 0:
        arr.append(i)
flag = 0
for i in range(len(arr)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):
        # if condition is True Print numbers
        if arr[i] + arr[j] == Number:
            flag = 1
            print(str(arr[i]) + " and " + str(arr[j]) + ' are prime numbers when added gives ' + str(Number))
            break
if flag == 0:
    print('No Prime numbers can give sum of ' + str(Number))
